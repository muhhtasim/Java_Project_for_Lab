# Java Calculator Project for OOP Lab

This is a **Java-based Calculator Application** developed as a lab project for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course.  
The project demonstrates the practical application of OOP concepts like **Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism** in a real-world scenario.

---

## **Project Overview**
This calculator is designed to provide a simple and user-friendly interface similar to a standard handheld calculator.  
It performs basic arithmetic operations like **addition, subtraction, multiplication, division**, as well as **percentage, square root, positive/negative toggle**, and supports **decimal calculations**.

The project is implemented using **Java Swing GUI**, making it interactive and visually appealing.

---

## **Features**
- **User-Friendly GUI** built with Java Swing
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`
- **Advanced Operations:** `%`, `√`, `+/-`
- **Clear (AC) Button** to reset all inputs
- **Decimal Support** and input validation to avoid errors
- **Error Handling:** Handles invalid operations like square root of negative numbers
- **Clean Output Display:** Removes unnecessary `.0` for integers

---

## **OOP Concepts Applied**
- **Encapsulation:** Private variables and public methods to access them  
- **Abstraction:** Hides complex logic from the user, exposing only required operations  
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Logical structure allows easy reuse and extension  
- **Modularity:** Separate methods for calculations, display updates, and event handling  

---

## **Technologies Used**
- Java (JDK 8+)
- Java Swing (GUI)
- AWT Event Handling

---

## **Usage**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```muhhtasim
   git clone https://github.com/muhhtasim/Java_Project_for_Lab.git


🧪 Usage Example

When you run the application:
The calculator window opens with numeric buttons and operation buttons.
Click numbers and operations in sequence.
Press = to get the result.
Press C to clear the input.

Example:
Input: 12 + 7
Press '=' → Output: 19


💡 What I Learned / Motivation

Practiced GUI development using Java Swing.
Implemented event handling for button clicks.
Reinforced OOP concepts: classes, objects, methods.
Learned the importance of clean and modular code.
